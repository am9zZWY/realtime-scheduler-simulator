# Realtime Scheduling Simulator

This code was part of the lecture "Realtime Systems" from Prof. Dr. Michael MÃ¤chtel at the HTWG Konstanz (UAS). It was written from scratch in C over the span of multiple weeks. Each week we had to extend the existing code basis. This is the final code basis.

## Requirements

- Make
- GCC

## Compiling it

```bash
make simulator
```

## Running it

```bash
./simulator
```
